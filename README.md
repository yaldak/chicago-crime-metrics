## Background
The city of Chicago is notoriously known for its crime and corruption. Some of the biggest crime syndicates have at some point based themselves in Chicago. With that in mind, our team decided to study crime and how it has changed over the years. In general, we want to look at how time affects crime. We want to look at daily totals to see if there are any correlations.

## Questions to Investigate
### Big Question: Does day of Month affect Crime Rates in Chicago?
<b>Exploratory Sentences</b>
1. What crimes happen the most?
2. What crimes happen the most at the end of the month?
3. Is the difference satistically significantly from other crimes?

## Process and Methodology
- [x] Mock up JavaFx formatting
- [x] Specify types of data needed for plotting
- [ ] Save plots 
- [ ] Implement data filtering for graphs
- [ ] Finish paper

## Requirements

- [x] Interfaces - Reader API
- [ ] Binary I/O - 
- [x] Generics - Generating graph data
- [x] Collections - With Streams (MainSceneController)
- [x] Nested Classes/Enums - We used Nested Classes
- [x] Streams - Reading the data
- [x] Lambdas - Used in Streams 
- [x] GUI - JavaFx
